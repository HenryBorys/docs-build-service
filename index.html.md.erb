This topic provides an overview of Pivotal Build Service (Alpha).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To request early access to this Pivotal Build Service alpha release, contact <a href="https://pivotal.io/contact">Pivotal</a>.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This release of Pivotal Build Service is not intended for use in a production environment. Features are subject to change without notice in future releases.</p>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Pivotal Build Service uses the open-source Cloud Native Buildpacks project to turn app source code into container images. Build Service executes reproducible builds that align with modern container standards, and triggers builds when container dependencies change. You can use Build Service to develop containerized software securely and at scale.

For more information about the Cloud Native Buildpacks project, see the [Cloud Native Buildpacks](http://buildpacks.io) documentation.

For more information about modern container standards, see the [Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md) in the OCI Image Format Specification repository on GitHub.


## <a id='image-and-project'></a> Image and Project Configurations

Build Service reduces operational overhead and improves security by automating builds of container images for apps in your environment.

To organize container image builds, Build Service defines `image` and `project` entities, as in the sections below. To define and modify configurations for `image` and `project` entities, you can use the Build Service CLI, `pb`.

### <a id='image-config'></a> Build Service Images

Build Service `image` configurations are defined by `.yml` files that include:

* The registry location of a built container image
* Source code for the image
* The project that owns the image
* Other configuration values, as described in the [Image Configurations](using.html#create-image) section of the _Using the Pivotal Build Service CLI_ topic

If you change a field in an image configuration file and run `pb image apply` with the file, Build Service rebuilds the container image based on its new configuration.

For more information about managing images in Build Service, see the [Manage Images](using.html#manage-images) section of the _Using the Pivotal Build Service CLI_ topic.

### <a id='project-config'></a> Build Service Projects

Build Service `project` configurations include:

* The development team that owns container images, as managed by a User Account and Authentication (UAA) server

* Container registries for the project's images, and the registry credentials to access them

* A `builder` file that defines the languages, buildpack versions, plugins, and other build configurations that the project uses

Build Service projects have the following constraints:

* All members of a project are also project owners and are able to create new images, manage secrets, and add or remove other users from the project.

* Only the users that belong to a project are able to create images against the project and check the builds against an image.

* To add a user to a project, the user email address must exist in UAA.

* You cannot use a previously existing UAA user group as a Build Service project. You must add users individually with `pb project` commands.

* Each project must have at least one project member.

For more information about creating and managing projects in Build Service, see the [Manage Projects](using.html#manage-projects) section of the _Using the Pivotal Build Service CLI_ topic.
