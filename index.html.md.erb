<p class='note warning'><strong>Note:</strong> Tanzu Build Service 1.0.1 is currently only available as a release candidate. These docs are a work-in-progress and may contain some inaccurate or missing info. The final documentation for this page will be available here when TBS is fully GA soon. </p>

This topic provides an overview of Tanzu Build Service.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) project to turn application source code into [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md).
Build Service executes reproducible builds that align with modern container standards, and additionally keeps images up-to-date.
It does so by leveraging Kubernetes infrastructure with [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack), a Cloud Native Buildpacks Platform, to orchestrate the image lifecycle.
The [kpack CLI tool, kp](https://github.com/pivotal/build-service-cli/blob/master/docs/kp.md) can aid in managing kpack resources.

Build Service helps you develop and automate containerized software workflows securely and at scale.

## <a id='concepts'></a> Build Service Concepts

Build Service reduces operational overhead and improves security by automating the building of application images.
It relies on `Image`, `Builder`, `ClusterStore` and `ClusterStack` to achieve these results.

### <a id='image'></a> Image

An `Image` defines the source of the application, build time environment and registry destination. This source code could reside in git, a blobstore, or as code on a workstation.

For more information see the [Managing Images and Builds](managing-images.html) page.

### <a id='builders'></a> Builder

A `Builder` references the Stack and Buildpacks that are used in the process of building source code. They "provide" the Buildpacks that run against the application and the OS images upon which the application is built and run.

For more information see the [Managing Builders](managing-builders.html) page.

### <a id='store'></a> ClusterStore

A `ClusterStore` serves as a repository for Cloud Native Buildpacks available for use in Builders. One can populate a store with Buildpacks they [create](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/) and [package](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack).

For more information see the [Managing ClusterStores](managing-stores.html) page.

### <a id='stacks'></a> ClusterStack

A `ClusterStack` defines a pair of build and run OS images. Critical security vulnerabilities are addressed by building apps on the most up-to date stack. The stacks used by Build Service to build applications are referenced in the Builders.

For more information see the [Managing ClusterStacks](managing-stacks.html) page.
