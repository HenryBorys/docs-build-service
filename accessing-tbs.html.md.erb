owner: Build Service Team

To use your Build Service installation, gain kubeconfig access to the Kubernetes Cluster that has the Build Service installed.
For example, if you are using TKGI (formerly PKS):

```
tkgi login -a <tkg-api-url> -u <username> -p <password>
tkgi get-credentials <clustername> -a <tkg-api-url> -u <username> -p <password>
```

You can use the [kp cli](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack-cli/blob/master/docs/kp.md), downloaded as part of the [installation](installing.html) to interact with Build Service.
The [kp cli](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack-cli/blob/master/docs/kp.md) uses the local `KUBECONFIG` utilized by `kubectl`. All operations will be performed on kubernetes current-context namespace.

```
$ kp
kp controls the kpack installation on Kubernetes.

kpack extends Kubernetes and utilizes unprivileged kubernetes primitives to provide
builds of OCI images as a platform implementation of Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB).
