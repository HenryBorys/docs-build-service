<p class='note warning'><strong>Note:</strong> Tanzu Build Service 1.0.1 is currently only available as a release candidate. These docs are a work-in-progress and may contain some inaccurate or missing info. The final documentation for this page will be available here when TBS is fully GA soon. </p>

A ClusterStack is a cluster scoped resource that provides the build and run images for the [Cloud Native Buildpack stack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/stack/) that will be used in a [Builder](managing-builders.html).

The [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/) page provides the following stacks and their updates.

| Name | ID |
|---|---|
| tiny | io.paketo.stacks.tiny |
| base | io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic |
| full | io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic |

Information on what these stacks contain and their ideal use cases can be found [here](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/stacks#use-cases)

**kp cli** can be used to manage clusterstack

```
$ kp clusterstack
Cluster Stack Commands

```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins (i.e. users with the <code>pb-admin-role</code> kubernetes ClusterRole) can perform clusterstack commands.</p>

## <a id='create-stack'></a> Create a ClusterStack

Users can create a clusterstack using build and run images from a Docker registry or the local machine.
The run and build images provided during clusterstack creation will be uploaded to the `canonical repository`, which is the `docker-repository` specified during TBS install.


- If using a Docker registry for the stack images:

    ```
    kp clusterstack create <clusterstack-name> \
     --build-image <location of build-image> \
     --run-image <location of run-image>
    ```

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have read access to the source Docker registry and write access to the canonical registry on the local machine.</p>

    Example:

    ```
    kp csk create my-clusterstack \
     -b gcr.io/test/stack/run:latest
     -r gcr.io/test/stack/build:latest
    ```

* If using local stack images created with `docker save`:

    ```
    kp clusterstack create <clusterstack-name> \
     --build-image <path to build-image>.tar \
     --run-image <path to run-image>.tar
    ```
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have write access to the canonical registry on the local machine.</p>
    Example:

    ```
    kp csk create my-clusterstack \
      -b ./local-build-image.tar \
      -r ./local-run-image.tar
    ```

## <a id='update-stack'></a> Update a ClusterStack

Users can update a stack using build and run images from a Docker registry or the local machine.
The run and build images provided during clusterstack update will be uploaded to the `canonical repository`, which is the `docker-repository` specified during TBS install.

- If using a Docker registry:

    ```
    kp clusterstack update <stack-name> \
     --build-image <location of build-image> \
     --run-image <location of run-image>
    ```
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have read access to the source Docker registry and write access to the canonical registry on the local machine.</p>
    Example:

    ```
    kp csk update my-clusterstack \
     -b gcr.io/test/stack/run:latest
     -r gcr.io/test/stack/build:latest
    ```

* If using local stack images created with `docker save`:

    ```
    kp clusterstack update <stack-name> \
     --build-image <path to build-image>.tar \
     --run-image <path to run-image>.tar
    ```
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have write access to the canonical registry on the local machine.</p>
    Example:

    ```
    kp csk update my-clusterstack \
      -b ./local-build-image.tar \
      -r ./local-run-image.tar
    ```

## <a id='get-stack-status'></a> Get ClusterStack Status

Users can get the current status of a clusterstack:

```
kp clusterstack status <stack-name>
```

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
Status:          Ready
ID:             org.cloudfoundry.stacks.cflinuxfs3
Run Image:      paketo/run:full-cnb
Build Image:    paketo/build:full-cnb
```

## <a id='delete-stacks'></a> Delete a ClusterStack

Users can delete an existing clusterstack:

```
kp clusterstack delete <stack-name>
```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> User will not be asked for a confirmation before deletion.</p>

## <a id='list-stacks'></a> List all ClusterStacks

Users can view the list of all ClusterStacks created:

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
NAME       READY    ID
base       True     io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic
default    True     io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic
full       True     org.cloudfoundry.stacks.cflinuxfs3
tiny       True     io.paketo.stacks.tiny
```

## <a id='image-update-stack-updates-only'></a> How to update an Image for Stack updates only?

To achieve Stack only updates for an Image, you can [pin the Buildpack versions](managing-builders.html#pin-buildpack-version) in the Builder used for creating the Image.
