This topic describes how to get started with kpack, a collection of open source resource controllers and CRDs that contain declarative build logic.


## <a id='prerequistites'></a> Prerequisites

This documentation assumes you have kpack installed, as well as the following:

* A Kubernetes cluster. To create a Kubernetes cluster, see [Using Minikube to Create a Cluster
](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* The `kubectl` CLI. To download the `kubectl` CLI, see [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* A Docker v2 registry. To create and run a Docker registry, see [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) in the Docker documentation.


## <a id='image-resource'></a> The Image Resource

A declarative build system is a system to which you declare the desired result of a build, which the system then builds on its own without direction. For example, when you give the system the names of the libraries a project depends upon, the system fetches the libraries and finds the source classes on its own. This is different from an imperative build system, which requires you to run commands to tell it how to do what you want to accomplish.

The `image` resource is what kpack utilizes to declaratively build app images. The following defines the relevant fields of the `image` resource spec in more detail:

- `tag`: The image tag.
- `builder`: Configuration of the `builder` resource the image builds use. For more information, see [Builder Configuration](#builder-config).
- `serviceAccount`: The service account name that is used for credential lookup.
- `source`: The source code that is monitored and built into images. For more information, see [Source Configuration](#source-config).
- `cacheSize`: The size of the volume claim that the build cache uses.
- `failedBuildHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of failed builds for an image that is retained.
- `successBuildHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of successful builds for an image that is retained.
- `imageTaggingStrategy`: Allow for builds to be additionally tagged with the build number. Valid options are `None` and `BuildNumber`.
- `build`: Configuration that is passed to every image build. For more information, see [Build Configuration](#build-config).

### <a id='builder-config'></a> Builder Configuration

The `builder` field describes the builder that builds the OCI images for a provided image configuration. It can be defined in one of the following ways:

* Cluster builder

    ```
    builder:
        name: CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME
        kind: ClusterBuilder
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the ClusterBuilder resource in Kubernetes.
    * `ClusterBuilder` is the type as defined in Kubernetes. This value is always `ClusterBuilder`.

* Namespaced builder

    ```
    builder:
        name: BUILDER-NAME
        kind: Builder
    ```
    Where:
    * `BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the Builder resource in Kubernetes.
    * `Builder` is the type as defined in Kubernetes. This value is always `Builder`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This image can only reference builders defined in the same namespace. This is not true for cluster builders because they are not namespace-scoped.</p>

### <a id='source-config'></a> Source Configuration

The `source` field is a composition of a source code location and a `subpath`. It can be configured in one of the following ways:

* Git

    ```
    source:
      git: GIT-REPOSITORY
        url: GIT-REPOSITORY-URL
        revision: GIT-REVISION
      subPath: SUBDIRECTORY
    ```
    Where:
    * `GIT-REPOSITORY` is the Git repository that contains the source code.
    * `GIT-REPOSITORY-URL` is the Git repository URL. Currently, only HTTPS repositories are supported.
    * `GIT-REVISION` is the Git revision you want to use. This value may be a commit SHA, branch name, or tag.
    * `SUBDIRECTORY` is a subdirectory within the source folder where the app code resides. This can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

* Blob

    ```
    source:
      blob: BLOB
        url: BLOB-URL
      subPath: SUBDIRECTORY
    ```
    Where:
    * `BLOB` is the blob in a blobstore that contains the source code.
    * `BLOB-URL` is the URL of the source code blob. Either this blob must be publicly accessible, or the access token must be contained in the URL.
    * `SUBDIRECTORY` is the subdirectory within the source folder where the app code resides. This can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

* Registry

    ```
    source:
      registry: OCI-IMAGE
        image: IMAGE-LOCATION
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: SECRET-NAME-LIST
      subPath: SUBDIRECTORY
    ```
    Where:
    * `OCI-IMAGE` is the OCI image in a registry that contains the source code.
    * `IMAGE-LOCATION` is the location of the source image.
    * `SECRET-NAME-LIST` is a list of `dockercfg` or `dockerconfigjson` secret names. This is required if the source image is private.
    * `SUBDIRECTORY` is a subdirectory within the source folder where the app code resides. This can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

### <a id='build-config'></a> Build Configuration

The `build` field on the `image` resource can be used to configure environment variables required during the build process and to configure resource limits on `CPU` and `memory`.

```
build:
  env:
    - name: ENV-VAR-NAME
      value: ENV-VAR-VALUE
  resources:
      limits:
        cpu: CPU-LIMIT
        memory: MEMORY-LIMIT
      requests:
        cpu: CPU-REQUEST
        memory: MEMORY-REQUEST
```
Where:
* `ENV-VAR-NAME` is the name of the environment variable.
* `ENV-VAR-VALUE` is the value of the environment variable.
* `CPU-LIMIT` is the amount of CPU the build is allowed to use.
* `MEMORY-LIMIT` is the amount of memory the build is allowed to use.
* `CPU-REQUEST` is the maximum CPU capacity of the build.
* `MEMORY-REQUEST` is the maximum memory capacity of the build.

For more information about setting environment variables, see [Define Environment Variables for a Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) and the [Resource requests and limits of Pod and Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) section of the _Managing Compute Resources for Containers_ topic in the Kubernetes documentation.

### <a id='create-builder'></a> Creating a Builder Resource

There are two types of builder resources that kpack supports. You must create these builder resources before you create any image resource, because they define which builder is used to create these images.

* **Namespaced builder**: This is a builder that exists inside a namespace and cannot be shared between namespaces. This property allows you to push the image of the builder to a private registry by giving the option to set `ImagePullSecret`. See the following example:

    ```
    apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Builder
    metadata:
      name: BUILDER-NAME
      namespace: NAMESPACE
    spec:
      image: BUILDER-IMAGE-TAG
      updatePolicy: UPDATE-POLICY
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: BUILDER-SECRET
    ```
    Where:
    - `BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the builder that the image references.
    - `NAMESPACE` is the namespace where the builder is created.
    - `BUILDER-IMAGE-TAG` is the builder image tag.
    - `UPDATE-POLICY` is the update policy of the builder. Valid options are `polling` and `external`. `external` requires you to update the resource by applying a new configuration, whereas `polling` automatically checks every five minutes to see if a new version of the builder image exists.
    - `BUILDER-SECRET` is an optional parameter that you should use only if the builder image is in a
    private builder that require credentials to access. To create this secret, see the [Create a Secret based on existing Docker credentials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials) section of the _Pull an Image from a Private Registry_ topic in the Kubernetes documentation.

* **Cluster builder**: This type of builder can be used inside any namespace. The image must exist in a publicly accessible registry. See the following example:

        ```
        apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterBuilder
        metadata:
          name: CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME
        spec:
          image: BUILDER-IMAGE-TAG
          updatePolicy: UPDATE-POLICY
        ```
        Where:
        - `CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the builder that the image references.
        - `BUILDER-IMAGE-TAG` is the builder image tag.
        - `UPDATE-POLICY` is the update policy of the builder. Valid options are `polling` and `external`. `external` requires you to update the resource by applying a new configuration, whereas `polling` automatically checks every five minutes to see if a new version of the builder image exists.

For more information about builders, see [Builders](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/builders.md) in the kpack repository on GitHub.

## <a id='create-image'></a> Creating an Image Resource

There are several resource types that work together to produce an image resource. This section describes how to configure and create each resource.

The YAML resources below each contain a `name` field. You should reference these names when configuring other resource types. To apply a particular resource type, run the command `kubectl apply -f ~/path/to/resource.yml`.

To configure and create a resource:

1. Create a namespace. This defines the partition inside which all of the builds run.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
        name: NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where:
    * `NAMESPACE` is the name you give the namespace.

1. Create a secret so kpack can push image builds to your desired registry. The `name` of this credential is referenced to create a service account.

    1. For GCR:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
     name: GCR-BUILD-NAME
     namespace: NAMESPACE
     annotations:
       build.pivotal.io/docker: gcr.io
    type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    stringData:
     username: USERNAME
     password: PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `GCR-BUILD-NAME` is the build name.
    * `NAMESPACE` is your namespace.
    * `USERNAME` is the username you define for the build.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password you define for the build.

    1. For Docker Hub:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
     name: DOCKER-BUILD-NAME
     namespace: NAMESPACE
     annotations:
       build.pivotal.io/docker: index.docker.io
    type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    stringData:
     username: USERNAME
     password: PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `DOCKER-BUILD-NAME` is the build name.
    * `NAMESPACE` is your namespace.
    * `USERNAME` is the username you define for the build.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password you define for the build.<br>
    For more information about Docker registry secrets, see [Secrets](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/secrets.md) in the kpack repository on GitHub.

1. Create a secret to give the build pull access from the desired Git repository. The example below is for a GitHub repository. You can also specify a personal access token. If you are building against source code that lives in a public registry, you do not need to configure a Git secret.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: GIT-BUILD-NAME
      namespace: NAMESPACE
      annotations:
        build.pivotal.io/git: https://github.com
    type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    stringData:
      username: USERNAME
      password: PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `GIT-BUILD-NAME` is the build name.
    * `NAMESPACE` is your namespace.
    * `USERNAME` is the username you define for the build.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password you define for the build.<br>
    For more information about Git registry secrets, see [Secrets](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/secrets.md) in the kpack repository on GitHub.

1. Create a service account that uses the Docker registry secret and the Git registry secret. When configuring the image resource, include the `name` of your Docker registry secret and the `name` of your Git repository secret.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: SERVICE-ACCOUNT
      namespace: NAMESPACE
    secrets:
      - name: DOCKER-BUILD-NAME
      - name: GIT-BUILD-NAME
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-ACCOUNT` is the name of the service account.
    * `NAMESPACE` is your namespace.
    * `DOCKER-BUILD-NAME` is the name of your Docker registry secret.
    * `GIT-BUILD-NAME` is the name of your Git repository secret.

1. Apply an image configuration to the cluster. In addition to specifying the source code URL and any build time environment variable names and values your app needs, you can also exercise additional control over how kpack executes builds. You can do this by specifying cache size, build history limit, and resources used.

    * To build an image from a Git repository:

      ```
      apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Image
      metadata:
        name: IMAGE
        namespace: NAMESPACE
      spec:
        tag: gcr.io/PROJECT-NAME/app
        serviceAccount: SERVICE-ACCOUNT
        builder:
          name: BUILDER-NAME
          kind: ClusterBuilder
        cacheSize: "CACHE-SIZE"
        failedBuildHistoryLimit: FAILED-BUILD-HISTORY-LIMIT
        successBuildHistoryLimit: SUCCESSFUL-BUILD-HISTORY-LIMIT
        source:
          git:
            url: GIT-REPOSITORY-URL
            revision: GIT-REVISION
        build:
          env:
            - name: ENV-VAR-NAME
              value: ENV-VAR-VALUE
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: CPU-LIMIT
              memory: MEMORY-LIMIT
            requests:
              cpu: CPU-REQUEST
              memory: MEMORY-REQUEST
        ```
        Where:
        * `IMAGE` is the name of your image.
        * `NAMESPACE` is your namespace.
        * `PROJECT-NAME` is the name of your project.

        * `CACHE-SIZE` is the size of the volume claim that the build cache uses. If you do not specify a size, the caching feature is disabled.
        * `FAILED-BUILD-HISTORY-LIMIT` is the maximum number of failed builds for an image that is retained. If you do not specify a limit, the default limit of `10` is used.
        * `SUCCESSFUL-BUILD-HISTORY-LIMIT` is the maximum number of successful builds for an image that is retained. If you do not specify a limit, the default limit of `10` is used.
        * `GIT-REPOSITORY-URL` is the Git repository URL. Currently, only HTTPS repositories are supported.
        * `GIT-REVISION` is the Git revision you want to use. This value may be a commit SHA, branch name, or tag.
        * `ENV-VAR-NAME` is the name of the environment variable.
        * `ENV-VAR-VALUE` is the value of the environment variable.
        * `CPU-LIMIT` is the amount of CPU the build is allowed to use.
        * `MEMORY-LIMIT` is the amount of memory the build is allowed to use.
        * `CPU-REQUEST` is the maximum CPU capacity of the build.
        * `MEMORY-REQUEST` is the maximum memory capacity of the build.

    * If you would like to build an image from a hosted ZIP or JAR:

        ```
