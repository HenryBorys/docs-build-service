## <a id="1-4-2"></a> v1.4.2

**Release Date: January, 11, 2022**

This release includes a few notable new features:

- TBS can now import a "full" or "lite" descriptor which will use different sets of buildpacks for different use cases. See [intallation](installing.html) for more details.
- The mechanism to sync secrets to build namespaces has changed. Users should now leverage the Carvel secretgen-controller for copying secrets to build namespaces. See the [Secret Synchronization page](synced-secrets.html) for more defails.

### Breaking Changes

- Installation steps have changed slightly. Some flags have changed and you must specify a descriptor name as part of installation. See [intallation](installing.html) for more details.
- Secrets copied to Build namespaces using the old secret-syncing mechanism will be cleaned up. Only copies of secrets will be deleted, original secrets with the `com.vmware.tanzu.buildservice.sync: "true"` label will not be deleted.


### Bug Fixes

- Fix http(s) proxy support with git using HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY env vars
