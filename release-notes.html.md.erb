## <a id="1-0-1"></a> v1.0.1

**Release Date: August 19, 2020**

**1.0.1** represents the first GA release of the Tanzu Build Service.

This release includes a new [install](installing.html) process that does not depend on duffle or the docker daemon. 

Notable improvements in the install experience:

* The Tanzu Build Service installation uses the modular [k14s](https://k14s.io/) tooling to template and install.
	* `kbld` is used to relocate images.
	* `ytt` is used to template kubernetes installation manifests.
	* `kapp` is used to apply the kubernetes configuration and process updates.
* The installation and relocation of buildpack and stack dependencies is accomplished separately via the `kp` cli with the new `import` command.

This release includes the 0.1.0 release of kpack which incorporates a new more consistent api within the kpack.io api group. Notably, the CustomBuilder and CustomClusterBuilder resources have been renamed to Builder and ClusterBuilder and the Stack and Store have been renamed to ClusterStack and ClusterStore.  

The Project functionality in previous versions of Tanzu Build Service has been removed to allow users to configure RBAC and namespaces externally from TBS.
