title: Updating Build Service Dependencies
owner: Build Service Team
---

Visit the [Build Service dependencies tile on PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies). Build Service can be updated with those artifacts both directly against the PivNet registry or via the downloaded versions of those images.

### Online update of Dependencies

If the `pb` CLI has access to pull images from the Pivnet Registry, the stack images and buildpacks used by build service can be updated using the following commands.

#### Stack Update

Update the stack:

    pb stack update --build-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build@sha256:<image-sha> --run-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run@sha256:<image-sha>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Both build and run images need to be provided to update the stack.</p>

The updated stack can be viewed with the following command:

    pb stack status

#### Store Update

Update the store:

    pb store add registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack-name>:<buildpack-tag>

Additionally, multiple buildpacks can be added to Build Service by passing multiple image references

    pb store add registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack1>:<buildpack1-tag> registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack2>:<buildpack2-tag> registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack3>:<buildpack3-tag>

To list the buildpacks now available to build service:

    pb store list

### Offline update of Dependencies

If the `pb` CLI cannot access the images in the Pivnet Registry, the stack images and buildpacks used by build service can be updated by first downloading those images and saving them as `.tar` files. These file can be provided to the `pb` CLI to upload to build service.

#### Stack Update

Fetch the stack images into the docker daemon:

    docker pull registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build@sha256:<image-sha>
    docker pull registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run@sha256:<image-sha>

Save those images to disk:

    docker save registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build@sha256:<image-sha> > build.tar
    docker save registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run@sha256:<image-sha> > run.tar

Update the stack with the saved image:

    pb stack update --build-image build.tar --run-image run.tar --local

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Both build and run images need to be provided to update the stack.</p>

The updated stack can be viewed with the following command:

    pb stack status

#### Store Update

Fetch the buildpack images into the docker daemon:

    docker pull registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack1>:<buildpack1-tag>
    docker pull registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack2:<buildpack2-tag>

Save those images to disk:

    docker save registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack1>:<buildpack1-tag> > buildpack1.tar
    docker save registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/<buildpack2>:<buildpack2-tag> > buildpack2.tar


Update the store with the previously saved images:

    pb store add buildpack1.tar --local

Additionally, multiple buildpacks can be added to Build Service by passing multiple image references

    pb store add buildpack1.tar buildpack2.tar --local

To list the buildpacks now available to build service:

    pb store list
