title: Managing Builders
owner: Build Service Team

A Builder is a Tanzu Build Service resource used to manage [Cloud Native Buildpack builders](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/).

Builders contain a set of buildpacks and a stack that will be used to create images.

There are two types of Builders:

* Cluster Builders: Cluster-scoped Builders
* Builders: Namespace-scoped Builders

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins can manage Cluster Builders.</p>

## <a id='create-builder'></a> Creating a Builder

Use the [kp cli](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack-cli/blob/v0.1.1/docs/kp.md) to create a Builder:

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp clusterbuilder create <name> --tag <tag> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store>
    ```

* Builder:

	```
    kp builder create <name> --tag <tag> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

Where:

* `name`: The name of the builder.
* `tag`: The registry location where the builder will be created.
* `stack`: The name of the stack to be used by the builder.
* `store`: The name of the store containing the buildpacks that will be used by the builder.
* `namespace` The kubernetes namespace for the builder (for Builders only)
* `order`: The local path to the buildpack order YAML that the builder will use.
  Sample order YAML files will be available on the [VMware Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies) page on Tanzu Network.
  For more information about listing buildpacks in groups in the order YAML, see [builder.toml](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/builder-config/#order-_list-required_) in the Buildpacks.io documentation.

  Example order YAML file that would be used by a builder designed to build NodeJS and Java apps:

  ```
  ---
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/gradle
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/nodejs
  ```

## <a id='patch-builder'></a> Patching a Builder

You can update a Builder resource using the [kp cli](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack-cli/blob/v0.1.1/docs/kp.md). To update a builder given a `name`, run:

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp clusterbuilder patch <name> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store>
    ```

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp builder patch <name> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

`kp ccb patch` and `kp cb patch` are respective aliases.

Where:

* `name`: The name of the builder.
* `stack`: The name of the stack to be used by the builder.
* `store`: The name of the store containing the buildpacks that will be used by the builder.
* `namespace` The kubernetes namespace for the builder (for Builders only)
* `order`: The local path to the buildpack order YAML that the builder will use.
  Sample order YAML files will be available on the [VMware Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies) page on Tanzu Network.
  For more information about listing buildpacks in groups in the order YAML, see [builder.toml](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/builder-config/#order-_list-required_) in the Buildpacks.io documentation.

  Example order YAML file that would be used by a builder designed to build NodeJS and Java apps:

  ```
  ---
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/gradle
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/nodejs
  ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The `tag` (location in a registry) of a builder cannot be modified. To change this field, you must create a new builder.</p>

## <a id='delete-builder'></a> Deleting Builders

To delete a Builder:

* Cluster Builder:

    ```
    kp clusterbuilder delete <builder name>
    ```

* Builder:

    ```
    kp builder delete <builder name> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting a builder will prevent image configs that reference that builder from successfully building again.</p>

## <a id='get-builder-details'></a> Retrieving Builder Details

To get builder details:

* Cluster Builder:

    ```
    kp clusterbuilder status <builder-name>
    ```

* Builder:

    ```
    kp builder status <builder-name> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

## <a id='list-builders'></a> Listing Builders

To list all builders available to the current user:

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp clusterbuilder list
    ```

* Builder:

	```
	kp builder list --namespace <namespace>
	```

## <a id='kpack-builder-resources'></a> Corresponding kpack Resources

All Build Service Builders are represented as kpack resources.

* [Builder](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/builders.md#builders)
* [ClusterBuilder](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/builders.md#cluster-builders)

## <a id='pin-buildpack-version'></a> Pinning Buildpack versions

You can pin buildpack versions by specifying the version for buildpacks in the order file.

As an **example**, consider the clusterbuilder created below:

```
kp cb create pinned \
  --tag my-registry.io/example/pinned \
  --order order.yaml
```
where the contents of order.yaml file is

```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When a buildpack version is pinned, Images that use the Builder will not initiate new Builds due to new Buildpack versions. For best practice, only pin a buildpack version when necessary. </p>
